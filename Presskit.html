      <h1>How would you describe the game in one sentence?</h1>

      <p>Hang Line is an extreme-physics climbing game where you swing up
        dangerous mountain peaks and rescue stranded survivors from avalanches and angry goats.</p>
      <br>

      <h1>What's the game about?</h1>
      <p>You play as an extreme climber equipped with a grappling hook, who flings himself up death-defying peaks to rescue survivors from disasters like plane crashes or cave-ins.</p>
      <p>Using the unique and intuitive one-tap control system, climb
        treacherous rock faces and navigate dangerous obstacles including angry
        mountain goats, falling boulders and shattering icicles. Use
        your grapple to drag obstacles and pull away ice blockages in order to
        clear the path forward. Swing yourself to safety as the mountain
        literally collapses around you.<br>
        <br>
        Play through a series of over 50 unique hand crafted levels, each
        offering its own unique challenges and surprises including avalanches
        and volcanoes. Earn awards and build up your rescue squad by searching for special items on the
        mountain and collecting unique character sets. </p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <h1>What's cool about the game?</h1>
      <p>It's simple to pick up, but extremely hard to master. The controls
        allow for a high degree of precision but the variability of the physics
        constantly surprises. Every element in the game interacts with every
        other element. Goats can kick cats, cats can pounce on explosives,
        explosives can explode stalactites, stalactites can crush goats... When
        this number of systems are all interacting as the player swings and
        bounces around on an elastic grapple line - you never know what to
        expect. And that's extremely entertaining. </p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <h1>Who is the developer?</h1>
      <p>A 17 year game design veteran, Ed Kay has been dreaming of making his
        own game since discovering the Doom level editor in 1996. But after a
        career of headshots, explosions and special moves spanning Cthulhu to
        Bulletstorm, it wasn't until having his dreams shattered from the
        Lucasarts apocalypse that he decided it was time to escape the constant
        loop of shipping and layoffs that plagues AAA console development. </p>
      <p>So he stepped sideways into the indie scene and began learning all the
        stuff you don't have to do as a design lead, including tweaking polygons
        and sinking deep into the void of functions and IF statements.
        Eventually, in 2016 he made the decision to go solo, and quickly realised making a game alone is rather difficult. Ed wrote an article about this here:<br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EdKay/20170801/302776/Climbing_an_impossible_mountain_the_struggles_of_making_a_game_alone.php">Climbing an Impossible Mountain</a></p><p><br>
      </p>
      <h1>Where did the idea come from?</h1>
      <p>The idea of creating a climbing game came from Ed's own feeble attempts
        at climbing large boulders on the beaches north of San Francisco. There's
        something very primal and exhilarating about the danger of hanging on to
        a piece of rock when once false move could put you in hospital. This
        seemed like an ideal premise for an action game on mobile. But after
        evaluating a ton of climbing games on the app store, it seemed almost
        impossible to think of a solid control system that was easy enough to pick up but also gave a high degree of control. The idea was almost abandoned until a simple
        solution appeared...</p>
      <p>Screw it - just give the guy a grappling hook. And thus Hang Line was
        born.</p>
      The one-touch elastic grappling controls were easy to pick up but super hard to master, so the game learned towards very deliberate setups rather than a constant fast on-rails rush. Being able to take the game at your own
      pace instead of just reacting to the obstacles thrown at you was an
      important part of the design. Focusing mostly on hand crafted levels was intentional to
      create a very deliberate pace, provide some special moments and to give
      individual levels charm and personality. But later he did actually end up adding an infinite mode because... game dev.<br>

      </p>
      <h1>Why free to play?</h1>

      <p>A core goal of this game was to reach as big an audience as
        possible, hence making it free so that anyone
        can download and play it. </p>
